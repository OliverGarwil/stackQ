## Introduction

**React Native Firebase** makes using [Firebase](http://firebase.com) with React Native simple. It provides a _light-weight_ layer on-top of the native Firebase SDKs (iOS & Android) whilst mirroring the Firebase Web SDKs API as closely as possible.

## Why 

Although the some features from the [Firebase Web SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) will generally work with React Native, it is mainly built for the web and as such has a limited compatible feature set.

We use the Firebase Native SDKs allowing us to provide APIs to a vast majority of Firebase products and services.

See the [Supported Firebase Features](#supported-firebase-features) table below to compare our supported features.
