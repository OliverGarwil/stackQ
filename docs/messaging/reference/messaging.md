# Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging ([FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)) allows you to send push messages at no cost to both Android & iOS platforms.

As the Firebase Web SDK has limited messaging functionality, the following methods within `react-native-firebase` have been created to handle FCM in the React Native environment.

Badge notification is well known on the iOS platform, but also supported by different Android devices / launchers. This library uses the [ShortcutBadger](https://github.com/leolin310148/ShortcutBadger) library to set the badge number also on Android. A list of supported launcher can be found there.

!> On iOS, your app first needs to [ref messaging#requestPermission] in order to receive Cloud Messages.
