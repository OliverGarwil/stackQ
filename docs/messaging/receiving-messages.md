# Receiving Firebase Cloud Messages

## 1) Check permissions

Before you are able to send and receive Cloud Messages, you need to ensure that the user has granted the correct permissions:

```js
const enabled = await firebase.messaging().hasPermission();
```

## 2) Request permissions

If the user has not already granted permissions, then you can prompt them to do so, as follows:

```js
try {
    await firebase.messaging().requestPermission();
    // User has authorised
} catch (error) {
    // User has rejected permissions
}
```

## 3) Listen for FCM messages

To receive messages, we make use of the `onMessageReceived` method.  This will be triggered when the device receives a `data-only` message from FCM. 

> For `notification-only` or `notification + data` messages, please see the [notifications section](version /notifications/receiving-notifications).

```js
// Optional: Flow type
import type { Message } from 'react-native-firebase';

componentDidMount() {
    this.messageListener = firebase.messaging().onMessage(message: Message => {
        // Process your message as required
    });
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    this.messageListener();
}
```
