## Install

Install React Native Firebase from NPM:

 - Click the `Add project` box as shown below:

## Usage

Once you've completed setting up React Native Firebase you can now use the library within your JavaScript code like any other node module

> The default app is pre-initialized natively therefore there is **no** need to call `initializeApp` for the default app instance.

### Example Usage

```javascript
import firebase from 'react-native-firebase';

firebase.auth()
  .signInAnonymously()
  .then(credential => {
    if (credential) {
      console.log('default app user ->', credential.user.toJSON());
    }
  });
```

### Creating multiple app instances

React Native Firebase supports multiple app instances. For more information see the [initializing multiple apps documentation](version /core/initialize-apps).
