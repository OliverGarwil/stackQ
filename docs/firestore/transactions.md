# Cloud Firestore Transactions

A transaction is a set of read and write operations on one or more Cloud Firestore documents that execute in a single atomic operation - either all of the operations succeed, or none of them are applied.

Transactions are useful when you want to update a field's value based on it's current value or the value of some other field. For example you could increment a counter by creating a transaction that reads the current value of the counter, increments it, and writes the new value to Cloud Firestore.

A transaction can consist of any number of `get()` operations followed by any number of write operations using methods such as `set()`, `update()` and `delete()`.

## Caveats

When using transactions the following points should be kept in mind:

- **Transactions** will **fail** when the client is **offline**.
- **Read** operations are **asynchronous** (Promises).
- **Read** operations must come **before write** operations.
- Your **updateFunction** **can return** a **Promise**.
- **Write** operations are **synchronous** but don't apply until after your `updateFunction` has finished executing.
- Your transaction `updateFunction` might run more than once if a concurrent edit affects a document that the transaction reads.
- Transaction `updateFunction` should not directly modify react state, you'd do this in the result of the transaction.

## Examples

### Increment a value

This example demonstrates incrementing a number transactionally even if a doc does not already exist and then returning the new value as the transaction result.

```javascript
import { firestore } from 'react-native-firebase';

const ref = firestore.collection('cities').doc('London');

firestore
  .runTransaction(async transaction => {
    const doc = await transaction.get(ref);

    // if it does not exist set the population to one
    if (!doc.exists) {
      transaction.set(ref, { population: 1 });
      // return the new value so we know what the new population is
      return 1;
    }

    // exists already so lets increment it + 1
    const newPopulation = doc.data().population + 1;

    transaction.update(ref, {
      population: newPopulation,
    });

    // return the new value so we know what the new population is
    return newPopulation;
  })
  .then(newPopulation => {
    console.log(
      `Transaction successfully committed and new population is '${newPopulation}'.`
    );
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('Transaction failed: ', error);
  });
```


### Abort a transaction

This example extends on the previous example and aborts the transaction if the population is greater than 5.


```javascript
import { firestore } from 'react-native-firebase';

const ref = firestore.collection('cities').doc('London');

firestore
  .runTransaction(async transaction => {
    const doc = await transaction.get(ref);

    // if it does not exist set the population to one
    if (!doc.exists) {
      transaction.set(ref, { population: 1 });
      // return the new value so we know what the new population is
      return 1;
    }

    // exists already so lets increment it + 1
    const newPopulation = doc.data().population + 1;

    if (newPopulation <= 5) {
      transaction.update(ref, {
        population: newPopulation,
      });
    } else {
      // returning a promise reject will abort the transaction
      return Promise.reject(new Error('Population too big!'));
    }

    // return the new value so we know what the new population is
    return newPopulation;
  })
  .then(newPopulation => {
    console.log(
      `Transaction successfully committed and new population is '${newPopulation}'.`
    );
  })
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.message.contains('Population too big')) {
      // Population too big - handle this specific error
    } else {
      console.log('Transaction failed: ', error);
    }
  });
```
