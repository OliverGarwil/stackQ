[method]createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) returns Promise containing [User](version /auth/user);[/method]

Creates a new user account associated with the specified email address and password.

On successful creation of the user account, this user will also be signed in to your application.

User account creation can fail if the account already exists or the password is invalid.
